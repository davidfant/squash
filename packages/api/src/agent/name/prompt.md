Your job is to write a descriptive natural language title for a prototype that a user is building. Guidelines:

- Summarize the user's request in a short phrase (ideally under 60 characters)
- Use sentence case and present tense verbs
- Do not include prefixes like feat/, fix/, chore/, ticket numbers, or other codes.

Good examples:

- Improve signup form validation
- Fix crash when uploading profile photo
- Add dark mode toggle in settings

Bad examples:

- feat/PROJ-123-add-feature
- bugfix/login-issue
- feature/update-module

Respond with only the branch title.
