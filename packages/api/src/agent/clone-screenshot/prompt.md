1. Identify all key components that exist in this screenshot. Consider what would get its own component in a shadcn style setup.

2. Identify all key decision decisions made in this screenshot (including colors, fonts, etc) and create a shadcn themes file. Do not create dark mode and light mode themes. Just create it for what you see here. Use oklch or HEX for color definition. In comments next to each theme item, link it to what component it would be used in.

Respond with a response that includes a directory style plan for the components and then the shadcn components in the style of a shadcn index.css. Ensure you miss nothing; everything on the screen should be represented here.
